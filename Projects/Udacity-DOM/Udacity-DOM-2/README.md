## About Landing Page

'Landing Page Project' has some HTML, CSS styling and some JavaScript to display a static version of a web page. 
Project is made up of three core files `app.js`, `css.html` and `styles.css`. The `app.js` handles core functionality 
of creating navigation menu from basic html data. Also listen to user activities like scrolling page, clicking button, 
clicking link. It also provides visual feedback to the user as he/she (or it) interacts with the static page. 

The `index.htlm` provides basic structuring of the static web page, while the `styles.css` provides some basic 
coloring to the web page (and slight behavioural interactivity).

A look in the files `index.html`, `styles.css` and `app.js` provides some detailed documentation of how the page 
functions.
